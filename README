The visual secure toolkit is a quick hack to Demo common and not so common attacks on IT systems.

It is an OpenSource toolkit and not to be used on any Live networks.

/!\ Use at your own risk and peril the code is NOT safe for Production networks and there are some vulnerabilities in the code as well.

The purpose was always to have an "offline" system for the sake of demoing potential attacks.
