bt_test will enumerate all adapters on a PC and make an assumption about the vendor to group the adapters.
Parallell Scanning will occur on all adapters and the return values will be added to an SQLite DB.
Every scan will receive a Unique ID and statistics will be produced about the Scan Session.

Stats:

- Scan Time
- Devices Seen (MAC)
- Devices Named (Name)
